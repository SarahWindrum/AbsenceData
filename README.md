# AbsenceData
MSc Analysis of Absence Data
Absence from work due to sickness and health-related issues is estimated to cost the UK economy over £100 billion per year in lost productivity according to the Department of Work and Pensions. In order to tackle this challenge, we must look at all factors that impact on our health and well-being. The World Health Organisation has identified ten social determinants of health (SDH) that they believe to account for 30-55% of health outcomes suggesting that non-medical factors have an impact on absence from work. 
In this analysis of absenteeism data collected over three years by a courier company in Brazil, I wanted to see if I could identify which non-medical factors have the greatest impact on workplace absence and evaluate whether this information could be used by businesses to create more tailored support to employees. 
My analysis follows the OSEMN Framework utilising summary statistics, Pearson’s correlation matrix, two-way cross tables, and Tableau visualisation to explore the dataset; and feature scaling for protection against outliers, dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis for efficiency and to reduce the risk of over-fitting, and KMeans clustering to model. 
My analysis uses Python code in PySpark and th full report is available below
